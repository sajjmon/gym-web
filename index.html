                Sweat FXBG is a boutique fitness studio in Fredericksburg, Virginia that offers group fitness classes in Sixty, our original concept HIIT class, Cycle, Barre, Row, and Yoga. In addition to group classes, we have an always open "Sweat Lab" that allows
                you to conduct individual training, on your own, or with a personal trainer. Sweat is NOT your average gym. Sweat was born from a desire to start a unique studio experience that we would be proud to call our own. Sweat is locally owned
                and operated and is a labor of love from a small team of passionate individuals. Regardless of your age or physical fitness level, Sweat is an all-inclusive group fitness studio that offers a variety of group and individual level programming
                to meet your needs</p>
